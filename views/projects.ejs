Proud of building this as part of my academic journey and learning full-stack development hands-on!
This project simplifies employee record management, attendance tracking, leave handling, and salary processing through dedicated admin and employee dashboards. The admin panel allows efficient management of employee data, leave approvals, attendance records, and salary details, while employees can easily apply for leave, track attendance, and view their salary information.
Working on this project strengthened my understanding of backend development, database management, authentication, and dynamic UI creation. It also helped me improve problem-solving skills and gain practical experience in building real-world web applications.<br>
